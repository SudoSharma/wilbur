# Wilbur 
Wilbur is a robotics project, a personal captstone, and an experiment in [embodied cognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embodied_cognition) - the notion that only an agent interacting with the demanding complexity of the real world (or a digital representation), can develop true general intelligence. 

To this end, in this repository I will explore the interplay of computer vision (CV), natural language processing (NLP), and reinforcement learning (RL) in progressively complex phases that complement Wilbur's overall development. Because I'm a huge fan of Marvel, the project is naturally organized into "Marks", an unabashed homage to Tony Stark's various Iron Man prototypes:

## Mark One
Mark One was principally built to study objection detection and segmentation, but also uses RL techniques to track objects in its viewport. In the [mark_one/models](https://github.com/SudoSharma/wilbur/tree/master/mark_one/models) folder, you'll find the following preliminary models: 
- `resnet_sandbox`: a Jupyter Notebook containing my implementations of VGG and ResNet
- `unet_sandbox`: a Jupyter Notebook containing my implementation of U-Net. 
- `retinanet_sandbox`: a Jupyter Notebook containing my implementations of FPN and RetinaNet

## Mark Two
Coming soon.

## Mark Three
Coming soon.
