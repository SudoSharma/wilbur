# Wilbur 
Wilbur is an experiment in [embodied cognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embodied_cognition) - the notion that only an agent interacting with the demanding complexity of the real world (or a reasonable digital representation), can develop true general intelligence. 

I've been a self-taught student of topics in artificial intelligence for quite some time, and to that end, this is a personal capstone project. In this repository, I explore the interplay of computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning, individually, and in a multimodal capacity.

The project is organized in "Marks" - a unabashed homage to Tony Stark's various Iron Man prototypes:

## Mark One (M1)
"Mark One" is principally an excercise in objection detection and segmentation. There is also an element of reinforcement learning, using which I teach Wilbur to track objects in his viewport. In the [mark_one/models](https://github.com/SudoSharma/wilbur/tree/master/mark_one/models) folder, you'll find several Jupyter notebooks I've developed to study and build M1 from the ground-up. 
- `resnet_sandbox` contains my implementations of VGG and ResNet
- `retinanet_sandbox` contains my implementations of U-Net and RetinaNet

## Mark Two (M2)

## Mark Three (M3)
